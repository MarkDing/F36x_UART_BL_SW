F360 UART bootloader 
It contains several parts.
* Bootloader firmware 
* PC software application
* Sample user application code

About bootloader real size, we need to check .M51 file 
instead of checking project build result output. The 
reason is there some GAPS interval among vector table. 
Here is the example:
In IDE build output windows, we got code size is 947 bytes.
Program Size: data=75.0 xdata=1024 code=937
LINK/LOCATE RUN COMPLETE.  0 WARNING(S),  0 ERROR(S)
In .M51 file, we got code size is  0x3E7 = 999 bytes
